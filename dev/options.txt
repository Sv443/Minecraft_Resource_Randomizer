    2 - Randomize resource files across folders, but only with the same file extension (will be very random and also look pretty good)
    3 - Randomize everything, regardless of file extension (is the most random but also glitched)

    2 - Medium
    3 - Thorough
    4 - Very thorough (most random but also takes the longest)
